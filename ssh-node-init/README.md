#  SSH Node Init
Use this module to loop through an array of nodes and install the contents of `file/script.sh` on them. 

SSH options and script paths can be changed with input variables. Use the example file `terraform.tfvars.example` by renaming it to `terraform.tfvars` and configuring the script, node, and ssh options.
